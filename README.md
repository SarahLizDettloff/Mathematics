### Physics
Contains a python 2.7 console application which can solve a variety of physics equations. 
This console application contains all modules except for Sine Wave and Line Graph. It allows the access to any of these equations by simply entering in a value which coorelates with the dictionary.
Currently, it contains the following:
* Volume of a Frustum
* Planck's Constant
* Buoyancy Force Calculator
* The Big Four(Kinematic equations)
* Sinusoidal Wave
* Binet's Fibonacci Number


### Algorithms
Contains a python 2.7 console application which demonstrates algebraic notation. The application allows the user to input the chess piece type as well as the coordinates on a chess board to estimate potential moves. This is written, assuming no other chess pieces are on a board. 

### physicsApp
This is a .NETFramework windows form application written in C#. Background image and button were created using [GraphicsGale](https://graphicsgale.com/us/). The appication contains the calculator for the following:
* Volume of a Frustum
* Planck's Constant
* Buoyancy Force Calculator(helps calculate volume of object if needed)
* The Big Four(Kinematic equations)
* Binet's Fibonacci Number

### Hexadecimal to Decimal Calculator
Hexadecimal is also known as base 16 since it is a numeric system which contains 16 numbers. It has a rich history for being used in ancient times, as well as being an essential concept in computer science in modern times. 

### Decimal to Binary Calculator
Binary is a two base number system which is the simplest numeric system. Each digit represents a bit, which is why it is preferred by many computer engineers. Binary has a rich history that affected minds such as the philosopher Francis Bacon to the mathematician George Boole.

### Line Graph Comparison
Comparison line graph containing data from 1999 and 2000 of mean family incomes was obtained, then plotted with numPy and Mathplotlib.
Data collections were obtained through [US Data Gov](https://www.data.gov/)

Data for this particular graph can be found on: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/income-total-and-mean-and-median-family-income-in-1999-cos-2000
