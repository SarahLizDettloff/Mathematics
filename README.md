## About
Mathamatics is important in problem solving, understanding persception, and practicing logic. This journal consists of regular math practices created in Python version 2.7.14.

### Hexadecimal to Decimal Calculator
Hexadecimal is also known as base 16 since it is a numeric system which contains 16 numbers. It has a rich history for being used in ancient times, as well as being an essential concept in computer science in modern times. 

### Decimal to Binary Calculator
Binary is a two base number system which is the simplest numeric system. Each digit represents a bit, which is why it is preferred by many computer engineers. Binary has a rich history that affected minds such as the philosopher Francis Bacon to the mathematician George Boole.


### Example of a line graph with mean family income in 1999 compared to 2000
Comparison line graph containing data from 1999 and 2000 of mean family incomes was obtained, then plotted with numPy and Mathplotlib.

Example of graph results:

Data collections were obtained through https://www.data.gov/

Data for this particular graph can be found on: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/income-total-and-mean-and-median-family-income-in-1999-cos-2000


## Physics

### Volume of a Frustum
This volume was first introduced in ancient Egyptian times. It is theorized to be the equation which was used to originally build pyramids.

### Planck Constant
Planck Constant is used as a foundational concept in quantum mechanics since it is the quantum of action in a physical constant. Max Planck developed this concept along with many others that resulted in him winning the Nobel Prize in 1918. 

### Buoyancy Force Calculator
This calculator contains a function to calculate the volume of six different shapes for you, finding the radius by diameter, and of course calculates the buoyancy force using the following equation:  Fb = Vs × D × g

### The Big Four
The big four is a set of four equations which can be executed to find an unknown information about an object's motion. The kinematic equations are distributed in this application to execute the actual equation; however, in practical use the approach will be alerted to find the variable which is unknown. D is for displacement, A is for acceleration, T is for time, vi is for initial velocity, and vf is for final velocity. The four equations are:         
d = vi * t + 1/2 * a * t^2          
vf^2 = vi^2 + 2 * a * d     
vf = vi + a * t                     
d = ((vi + vf) / 2 ) * 2

### Sinusoidal Wave
A sine wave is the trigonometirc function of an angle executed by a visual graph. 
This example shows the periodic oscillations amplitude of displacement which is displayed at each point which is proportional to the sine of the phase angel of displacement. An example of the graph results:

This was executed in Jupyter Lab, Python 2.7, with imports from numPy and mathplotlib.

### Binet's Fibonacci Number
Simple calculator using Binet's Fibonacci formula will calculate for the n-th of a fibonacci number. The formula is Phi to the square root of n subtracted by negative Phi to the negative square root of n which is then divided by the square root of 5. Phi is the golden ratio which in this case is inputted into the seventh decimal place. The fibonacci sequence can be seen throughout nature from the petals in flowers, to pine cones, to seashells, to facial characteristics, to animals, to insects, and to spiral galaxies. 

### Summary
This console application contains all modules except for Sine Wave and Line Graph. It allows the access to any of these equations by simply entering in a value which coorelates with the dictionary.
