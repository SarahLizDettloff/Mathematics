# Python Math

# About
Mathamatics is important in problem solving, understanding persception, and practicing logic. This journal consists of regular math practices created in Python version 2.7.14.

# Volume of a Frustum
This volume was first introduced in ancient Egyptian times. It is theorized to be the equation whic was used to originally build pyramids.

# Hexadecimal to Decimal Calculator
Hexadecimal is also known as base 16 since it is a numeric system which contains 16 numbers. It has a rich history for being used in ancient times, as well as being an essential concept in computer science in modern times. 

# Planck Constant
Planck Constant is used as a foundational concept in quantum mechanics since it is the quantum of action in a phsyical constant. Max Planck developed this concept along with many others that resulted in him winning the Nobel Prize in 1918. 

# Decimal to Binary Calculator
Binary is a two base number system which is the simplest numeric system. Each digit represents a bit, which is why it is preferred by many computer engineers. Binary has a rich history that affected minds such as the philosopher Francis Bacon to the mathematician George Boole.

# Buoyancy Force Calculator
This calculator contains a function to calculate the volume of six different shapes for you, finding the radius by diameter, and of course calculates the buoyancy force using the following equation:  Fb = Vs × D × g

# The Big Four
The big four is a set of four equations which can be executed to find an unknown information about an object's motion. The kinematic equations are distributed in this application to execute the actual equation; however, in practical use the approach will be alerted to find the variable which is unknown. D is for displacement, A is for acceleration, T is for time, vi is for initial velocity, and vf is for final velocity. The four equations are:         
d = vi * t + 1/2 * a * t^2          
vf^2 = vi^2 + 2 * a * d     
vf = vi + a * t                     
d = ((vi + vf) / 2 ) * 2

# Sine Wave
A sine wave is the trigonometirc function of an angle executed by a visual graph. 
This example shows the periodic oscillations amplitude of displacement which is displayed at each point which is proportional to the sine of the phase angel of displacement. An example of the graph results:
