## Chess
This chess program utilizes algebraic notation by providing the user with the potential chess moves on a chess board. <br />
It allows the user to input the chess piece type as well as the coordinates on a chess board to estimate potential moves. <br />
This is written, assuming no other chess pieces are on a board. <br />
<br />
Example of chess board coordinates:
